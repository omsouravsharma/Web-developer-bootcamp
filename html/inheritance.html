            A wiki (/ˈwɪki/ (audio speaker iconlisten) WIK-ee) is a hypertext publication collaboratively edited and
            managed
            by its own audience directly using a web browser. A typical wiki contains multiple pages for the subjects or
            scope of the
            project and could be either open to the public or limited to use within an organization for
            maintaining its internal knowledge base.

            Wikis are enabled by wiki software, otherwise known as wiki engines. A wiki engine, being a form of a
            content
            management system, differs from other web-based systems such as blog software, in that the content is
            created
            without any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little inherent structure, allowing structure to emerge
            according to the needs of the users.[1] Wiki engines usually allow content to be written using a simplified
            markup language and sometimes edited with the help of a rich-text editor.[2] There are dozens of different
            wiki
            engines in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines
            are
            open source, whereas others are proprietary. Some permit control over different functions (levels of
            access);
            for example, editing rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material. Others may permit access
            without
            enforcing access control. Other rules may be imposed to organize content.
